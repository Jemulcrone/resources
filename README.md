## Resources

## Easy R Tutorial 📝:

### Overview: 

A tutorial for R for complete beginners that uses soil moisture calculations as an example. I wrote this for the Yang lab to provide easier access to learning coding skills to undergraduates and technicians who had no previous experience. The tutorial takes a few hours to go through and goes from basics through creating graphs and writing simple loops.  


## Soil Maps 🗺️:

### Overview: 

A presentation on using the SSURGO database and ArcGIS Pro to make soil maps including three examples.
